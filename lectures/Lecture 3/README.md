# Lecture 3: Matching estimators (I)

**Topics covered**:

* Review of concepts: potential outcomes and treatment effects, ATE vs. ATT, selection bias

* Subclassification as a method of estimating treatment effects: grouping treated and untreated observations into strata, calculating differences within strata, and taking a weighted average across strata.

* The conditional independence assumption (CIA) and methods relying on selection on observables.

* The role of common support

* Matching methods: exact matching, approximate matching (e.g., nearest neighbor)

* The propensity score: use in weighting and matching
