# Lecture 2: Regression estimation and inference (review)

## Topics covered:

* Review concept of *sampling distributions* and *standard errors*.

* Review of Gauss-Markov assumptions applied to simple linear regression, and what they tell us about the sampling distribution of the slope estimator.

* Review of Gauss-Markov assumptions applied to multiple linear regression.

* Review concept of *heteroskedasticity* and its consequences for the sampling distribution of the slope estimator.

* Use of *robust* standard error formula.

* *Boostrapping* as a tool for estimating standard errors.

* In-class exercise:
	* Simulating data from a known population distribution, and estimating a regression using OLS.
	* Illustration of omitted variables bias and regression anatomy formulas.
	* Bootstrapping examples.
