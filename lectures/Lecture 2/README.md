# Lecture 2: Regression estimation and inference (review)

Topics covered:

* Review concept of <em>sampling distributions</em> and <em>standard errors</em>.

* Review of Gauss-Markov assumptions applied to simple linear regression, and what they tell us about the sampling distribution of the slope estimator.

* Review of Gauss-Markov assumptions applied to multiple linear regression.

* Review concept of <em>heteroskedasticity</em> and its consequences for the sampling distribution of the slope estimator.

* Use of <em>robust</em> standard error formula.

* In-class exercise:
	* Simulating data from a known population distribution, and estimating a regression using OLS
	* Illustration of omitted variables bias and regression anatomy formulas
